# H-Bridge-Motor-Controller-Eagle
 The repository contains the PCB design schematic and layout of an H Bridge motor controller that I designed on Eagle. 
The file bridge.png provides the schematic of the motor controller. This schematic is drawn in Eagle and mapped onto a PCB, keeping in mind economical and aestheic considerations.
I do not own the image.
